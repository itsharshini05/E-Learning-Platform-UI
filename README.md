*DESCRIPTION*:The E-Learning Platform UI is a static, multi-page front-end interface designed to provide an organized and accessible learning experience. It is intended for online learners to browse available courses, watch educational videos, and view their learning progress.

This platform is typically used in schools, colleges, training centers, and by online course providers to deliver course content in a user-friendly format. By offering key features like course listings, video playback, and progress display, it supports remote education without needing dynamic scripting or interactivity.

The UI includes four main HTML pages:

1. index.html – The homepage introducing the platform and guiding users to different sections.


2. course.html – Displays a structured list of available courses in the home page, including course titles and descriptions.


3. video.html – Hosts embedded videos using the HTML5 <video> element or external platforms like YouTube via iframes.


4. progress.html – Presents progress information in a visual and text format (e.g., tables or checklists) to show course completion status.



A separate style.css file is used to design and maintain a consistent look across all pages. It handles layout, fonts, colors, spacing, and responsive design using CSS Flexbox or Grid.

Tools Used

HTML5: Builds the structure of each page.

CSS3: Styles the layout and appearance via an external stylesheet (style.css).

Responsive Design: Ensures pages work on desktops, tablets, and mobile devices using media queries.

Video Embedding: HTML5 <video> tags or iframe embeds allow smooth integration of learning videos.

This static UI does not rely on JavaScript and is ideal for simple, content-driven educational platforms. It serves as a clean and structured foundation that can later be enhanced with interactivity or connected to a back-end system.
